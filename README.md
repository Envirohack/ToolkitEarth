ToolkitEarth - connecting farmers to the latest satellite and weather data.

## Thoughts re. roadmap/wishlist

tl;dr: Draw a base map (OSM/MapBox/Leaflet?) with a LandSat option view mode, and then allow for weather input from both local-based weather stations (e.g. SmartCitizen.me/arduino)  and BOM/other upstream data sources. (If someone is super smart they can think about doing analysis of the local data and upstream data sources…)

Would be worth seeing if there are other existing projects in this space — many might appreciate these ideas and take them as extras/plugins/new features.
